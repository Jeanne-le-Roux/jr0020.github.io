Hi, I'm Jeanne' le Roux!
I'm a research associate,
🛠️  I'm currently working with the [IMPACT](https://impact.earthdata.nasa.gov/) team under [NASA's ESDS program](https://earthdata.nasa.gov/esds).
At IMPACT, I work with various Earth Science 🌎 data, products and algorithms.
When I'm not working, I like hiking, biking, and making art.
